## ðŸ‘‹ I'm RenÃ© Marves

I like to push the boundaries of what is possible and enable more people to do more things, to take innovative ideas and develop them into a reality.

I love programming and using software and automation to simplify life and free up time for the things that matter most.  I'm a Chemical Engineer, cerfified PMP since 2012, Master in Marketing, and currently studying Software Development.
